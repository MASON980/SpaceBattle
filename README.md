#SpaceBattle! </br>
</br>
A clone of SpaceWar! (1962). You control spaceships which can accelerate/decelerate, turn, shoot, and teleport; all around a sun/black hole.</br>
P1 is 'w'/'s' accelerate and deccelerate, 's'/'d' for turning, 'q' for shoot and 'e' for teleport</br>
P2 is 'i'/'k' accelerate and deccelerate, 'j'/'l' for turning, 'u' for shoot and 'o' for teleport</br>
This was made for education and what not, please don't sue.</br>
</br>
</br>

ISSUES: </br>
--The number of deaths starts again from 0 whenever it goes above 9</br>
</br>
</br>

TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)</br>
--Make the number of players changeable.</br>
